            <h2>My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future (With a special Epilogue for India)</h2>
            <p style="color: #aaa;"><b>> by Indra K. Nooyi (Author)</b></p>
               <p><b>An intimate and powerful memoir by the trailblazing former CEO of PepsiCo</b><br>
                
                  <br> For a dozen years as one of the world's most admired CEOs, Indra Nooyi redefined what it means to be an exceptional leader. <br> The first woman of colour and immigrant to run a Fortune 50 company – and one of the foremost strategic thinkers of our time <br> – she transformed PepsiCo with a unique vision, a vigorous pursuit of excellence, and a deep sense of purpose. Now, in a rich <br> memoir brimming with grace, grit, and good humour, My Life in Full offers a first-hand view of Nooyi's legendary career and the sacrifices it so often demanded <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br>
                
                 Nooyi takes us through the events that shaped her, from her childhood and early education in 2960s India, to the Yale School of Management, to her rise as a corporate consultant and strategist who soon ascended into the most senior executive ranks. The book offers an inside look at PepsiCo, and Nooyi's thinking as she steered the iconic American company toward healthier products and reinvented its environmental profile, despite resistance at every turn. For the first time and in raw detail, Nooyi also lays bare the difficulties that came with managing her demanding job with a growing family, and what she learned along the way. She makes a clear, actionable, urgent call for business and government to prioritize the care ecosystem, paid leave and work flexibility, and a convincing argument for how improving company and community support for young family builders will unleash the economy's full potential. 
                
                 Generous, authoritative, and grounded in lived experience, My Life in Full is the story of an extraordinary leader's life, a moving tribute to the relationships that created it, and a blueprint for 22st century prosperity.</span> <button onclick="myFunction()" id="myLink" style="cursor: pointer;">Read more</button></p>

            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p> 'With candor and good humor, Nooyi has written a wonderful book that brings her story to life, from her early years in India, surrounded by love and high expectations, to her determined efforts to succeed in the corporate world, all the while questioning the tradeoffs she had to make. She reveals just how our society continues to sacrifice talent instead of changing how we organize work to maximize everyone's potential to live full and productive lives. A must-read for working women and the men who work with us, love us, and support us.' <b>–Hillary Rodham Clinton</b><br>
                
                <br> 'A fascinating narrative of an intrepid woman who broke the barrier of gender and race to emerge as an iconic business leader of the twenty-first century. Indra Nooyi's leadership legacy is her trailblazing philosophy of 'Performance with Purpose', whose time has only just arrived!' <b>– Kiran Mazumdar Shaw,</b> Executive Chairperson, Biocon Limited <br>
                
                <br> 'My Life in Full is an engrossing account of the life of an extraordinary woman, from her early days in India to the pinnacle of one of the world's iconic corporations, breaking many glass ceilings on the way. Writing from the heart, Indra Nooyi shares her authentic story of finding great business success and balancing a close-knit family. Inspirational and a must read!'  <b>– Nandan Nilekani,</b>  Chairman and co-founder, Infosys and Founding Chairman UIDAI (Aadhaar) <br>
                
                <br> 'Indra Nooyi's life and career have been nothing less than inspirational. The passion with which she has approached every aspect of her life — her family, her role as a global business leader and even as a cricket enthusiast — shines through in her memoir, My Life in Full. Every reader will find in this book something that will stay with them — whether they are aspiring professionals or simply looking for wisdom gathered from a life well lived.' <b> – Sachin Tendulkar,</b> former captain of the Indian national cricket team and member of the World Cup 2011 winning team <br>
                
                 <br> 'My Life in Full is just what it says it is: a vibrant account of a full life, lived wisely and well. It is the untold story of a journey across continents made by a young woman growing up immersed in the values of India in the 1970s, and the sacrifices demanded of a working mother pursuing an ambitious career. Along the way, we get a glimpse of the extraordinary capacities that helped shape Indra Nooyi's distinctive leadership style, and her great ability to define a mission and bring people together to achieve it. We also discover how much more needs to be done with the care infrastructure so that women – and men – in the workplace of the twenty-first century can live full lives.' <b>– N. Chandrasekaran,</b>  Chairman, Tata Group <br>
                
                 <br> 'When a history of modern India is being written, women like Indra Nooyi will be the icons we read about and look up to as role models. She is an inspiration for generations of women in India and across the world. In her book, written in simple, relatable and emotional language, Indra Nooyi recounts beautifully the story of an immigrant and of a woman functioning at the apex of her abilities. Her achievements make her a beacon to the millions of girls who aspire to do more, be more – and in that her accomplishments belong not to her alone but to all women. Through this book she has effectively laid down a template of how it is done, and done right.' – Jaya Bachchan, award-winning actor and member of Parliament <br>
                
                 <br> 'Indra Nooyi's life story is one of absolute merit, grit and determination. Way before upskilling was a trend, she set the example of being a true life-long learner. Her journey from her Thatha's room to the PepsiCo chair has been marked by constant curiosity and innovation, and reflects deep values that transcend all cultures. I am glad that she decided to share her incredible journey with us, for rarely are we invited to learn from not just the achievements but also the regrets of a brilliant and immensely successful business leader.' <b>– Roshni Nadar Malhotra, Chairperson,</b> HCL Technologies <br>
                
                 <br> 'Gritty, joyous, and visionary, Nooyi tells the story of an everyday person living an extraordinary life, leading beautifully and confidently from the front. A must-read for all.' <b>– Ursula M. Burns, former chair and CEO of Xerox, author of Where You Are Is Not Who You Are</b> <br>
                
                 <br> '"CEO" and "care" do not usually go together, but for Indra Nooyi, they always have. Rather than offering us a list of policy prescriptions, she shows us what is possible when businesses care about family and families have time to care for one another.'<b>– Anne-Marie Slaughter, CEO of New America, author of Unfinished Business </b> <br>
                
                 <br> 'We have so much to learn from Nooyi's remarkable story and wisdom on lifting up girls and women in the decades to come. She shares a great road map for anyone who aspires to merge social change with leading a large organization.'<b>– Matt Damon, actor, screenwriter, producer</b > <br>
